## Week 4

Date: 2024/04/06

### Details

As there was no dedicated project time for this week, the meeting is not face-to-face, but a fusion of global remarks and a comprehensive Goolgle form.

### Present team members
- Maxime CARON
- Alexis LASSELIN
- Lucas AUBARD
- Habi CAILLEAU
- Paul NOWAK
- Wilfried PORTET

### Week objectives
- Continuing the implementation of multitasking
- Continue work on test plan/test case

### Week issues
- Difficulty to take time to work on the project since we have no dedicated time for it (all team members)

### Team remarks
- "This is the worst project of this school year for me." (Paul)

### Plan for next week
- Alexis LASSELIN and Wilfried PORTET:
  - Finish the operator manual

  - Review the test plan/test case

### Conclusion
The fact that the team didn't have dedicated time to work on the project for the whole week, and had other tasks to complete, made it difficult for everyone to take the time to work on the project, but they all did. It's important to point out that, as project manager; I made it compulsory for them to work for at least one hour during the week to ensure that the project was completed by the deadline, even if we had no time to devote to the project. The team is confident that the project will be completed before the end and are also very proud of their work.
