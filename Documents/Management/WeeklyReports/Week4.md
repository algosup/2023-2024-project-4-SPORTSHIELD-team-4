## Conclusion
The fact that the team didn't have dedicated time to work on the project for the whole week, and had other tasks to complete, made it difficult for everyone to take the time to work on the project, but they all did. It's important to point out that, as project manager; I made it compulsory for them to work for at least one hour during the week to ensure that the project was completed by the deadline, even if we had no time to devote to the project. The team is confident that the project will be completed before the end and are also very proud of their work.
