## Project Overview
This project aims to improve the current capabilities of the SPORTSHIELD prototype. SPORTSHIELD is a lock prototype that aims to secure sports equipment made by CORIS Innovation. The main target of the improvement will be the software to ensure the product's proper functioning.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to improve the SPORTSHIELD prototype focusing on the software. 
The team will work on the following tasks:
- Improve the software to reduce energy consumption.
- Add the possibility to unlock the SPORTSHIELD using an NFC device.
- Manage low battery levels and alert the user.
- Improve the software to make it able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Resources and Constraints
### Resources
The team will have access to the entire already developed software and the documentation.
| Equipment | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Development board | Ultra-compact, ultra-low-power Bluetooth development board based on the Nordic nRF52840. |
| Battery | Lithium-ion polymer rechargeable battery. | 
| GPS module | Module utilizes the MediaTek GNSS Chipset MT3333 that supports various location and navigation applications, including autonomous GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, QZSS, SBAS, DGPS, and AGPS. |
| GSM module | Miniature cellular module which allows for GPRS transmission. |
| NFC module | NFC, RFID antenna. |

The team will have access to the entire already developped software and the documentation.

### Constraints
The team will have to respect the following constraints:
- The project must be completed by 2024/04/10.
- The code must be written in Arduino.
- The software must be compatible with the hardware already developed.
- The Hardware must not be modified, except for the addition of components justified as useful.

## Risk and Mitigation
You can find the risk management plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oD6-9S7R8g9_v3i8xpIQvwrv3xktrlCw4Nu1wr1FqkM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Overall plan
To ensure the success of the project, the team will follow the following plan:
1. The team will start by understanding the client's needs and the current state of the project.
2. The team will define the most important features to develop and will write the functional and technical specifications.
3. The team will develop the software, write the test plan and the user manual.
4. Each time some code is written, the team will write unit tests and will add the bugs to the database of bugs.
5. The team will write weekly reports and management planning to keep the client informed of the project's progress.
