# NFC Component Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue

The NFC component, particularly the Molex 1462360031, is incompatible with the Arduino Xiao BLE board due to the absence of a suitable library. This issue presents a barrier to achieving NFC functionality within the project.

## Analysis

### Library Absence

The primary reason for the NFC component's failure to work with the Arduino Xiao BLE board is the absence of a suitable library. This library is crucial as it provides the necessary instructions for the NFC component to communicate effectively with the Arduino Xiao BLE board.

## Solutions

### 1. Writing the Library

#### Steps

1. **Research and Documentation:** Thoroughly research the specifications and technical documentation of both the NFC component and the Arduino Xiao BLE board.
2. **Code Implementation:** Develop code snippets to facilitate communication between the NFC component and the Arduino Xiao BLE board.
3. **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the library's functionality and compatibility with the Arduino Xiao BLE board.
4. **Optimization and Debugging:** Fine-tune the library code for optimal performance and address any bugs or errors encountered during testing.
5. **Documentation:** Document the newly created library, including usage instructions and function descriptions, for future reference.

### 2. Using an Alternative Arduino Board

#### Solution: Arduino Nano 33 BLE

1. **Identify Suitable Board:** Consider using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE as an alternative to the Arduino Xiao BLE board.
2. **Compatibility Check:** Verify compatibility of the NFC component with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and existing libraries.
3. **Procurement:** If compatible, procure the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board.
4. **Integration:** Replace the Arduino Xiao BLE board with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board in the project setup.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure NFC functionality with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board and compatibility with project requirements.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, resolving the compatibility issue between the NFC component and the Arduino Xiao BLE board can be achieved by either writing a new library or using an alternative Arduino board. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE serves as a suitable alternative, offering NFC functionality and potentially better compatibility with existing libraries. By adopting this approach, the project can efficiently overcome the NFC compatibility barrier without extensive library development efforts.
