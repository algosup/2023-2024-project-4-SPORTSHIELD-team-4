# SPORTSHIELD Team 4

**SPORTSHIELD** is an original anti-theft system for sports equipment. It's a project contracted by the company [Coris Innovation](https://www.corisinnovation.com/).

This device is designed to protect sports equipment such as skis and snowboards. It is composed of a **GPS** and a **GSM** module. The **GPS** module is used to locate the equipment, and the **GSM** module is used to send the location to the user's smartphone. The device is also equipped with a **gyroscope** to detect any movement of the equipment. The user can then be alerted in case of theft. The device is powered by a **battery** and can be recharged via a **USB-C** port. It's also equipped with an **NFC** module to unlock or lock the device. Finally, a **buzzer** is used to alert the user in case of theft.

For this project, Coris Innovation has asked us to:

- Increase the lifespan of the **battery**.ðŸ”‹
- Add the possibility to use **NFC** to unlock or lock the device.ðŸ”“
- Implement a way to manage simultaneous actions on the device.ðŸ”„

## Technologies used
