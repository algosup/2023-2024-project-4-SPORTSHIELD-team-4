- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The device's battery life will be extended to 7 days under optimal conditions, with up to 6 hours of active use per day.
  - Charging will be limited to 80% of the battery's capacity to prolong its lifespan.

#### B. NFC Functionality

To expand the device's capabilities, NFC functionality will be incorporated to facilitate device locking and unlocking:

**Objective**: Integrate NFC functionality to enable users to lock/unlock the device using their mobile phones.

- **How To Implement**:

  - Utilize the NFC tag M24LR6E library from Seed Studio to implement NFC functionality.
  - Employ the library to enable reading data from the NFC tag, which will be utilized for device locking and unlocking.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The device will support locking/unlocking via the mobile application using NFC functionality.
  - Testing of NFC functionality will be conducted using the NFC tag of a smartphone, as access to the mobile application is unavailable for testing purposes.

#### C. Simultaneous Actions Management

- How To Implement
  <!-- TODO -->

- Acceptance Criteria
  If we are able to implement the simultaneous actions management, the user will be notified when the alarm is activated.

#### D. Bluetooth Security

- How To Implement

- Acceptance Criteria

#### E. Alarm Management

- How To Implement
  To implement the alarm management, we will have to add a function linked to the NFC tag that will allow the user to halt the alarm once the ringing cycle initiates, something similar to the stop button on a fire alarm.
- Acceptance Criteria
  If the user is able to halt the alarm once the ringing cycle initiates, then the alarm management will be considered a success.

## III. Further Considerations

### 1. Constraints and Impact

<!--
How will this increase the work of other people?
-->

Because we're adding a lot of features in the device such as the alarm management or the NFC functionality, the team that is in charge of the mobile application will have to update the application to support these new features. This will increase their workload. They are those who will be most impacted by the changes we are making.

### 2. Considerations

#### A. Security Considerations

<!--
What are the potential threats?
How will they be mitigated?
How will the solution affect the security of other components, services, and systems?
-->

#### B. Privacy Considerations

<!--
Does the solution follow local laws and legal policies on data privacy?
How does the solution protect usersâ€™ data privacy?
What are some of the tradeoffs between personalization and privacy in the solution?
-->

Because we're only working on the device and not on how the data is handled, we don't have to worry about the privacy of the users' data. The company is in charge of the data and how it is handled. However, there is still a risk that the data could be compromised if the device is stolen. We will have to make sure that the device is secure enough to prevent this from happening.

#### C. Risks

<!--
What risks are being undertaken with this solution?
Are there risks that once taken canâ€™t be walked back?
What is the cost-benefit analysis of taking these risks?
-->

The main risk we are taking is that we are adding a lot of features to the device. This could lead to the device being more complex and therefore more prone to bugs. We will have to make sure that we test the device thoroughly to prevent this from happening.

There is a lot of risk that we will describe in the table below:

| Risk                                                                   | Impact                                                                                                      |
